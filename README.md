# Question-Answering with Transformers and LangChain

####
This project leverages the power of the Hugging Face transformers library and LangChain to build a simple question-answering system. It uses a pre-trained model (distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad) for extracting answers to user-input questions based on a provided context.

The system reads the context from a provided text and allows the user to ask natural language questions. The model answers based on the information present in the context.
